- 👋 Hi, I’m @4kammer
- 👀 I’m interested in insights that come from data analysis, I tend to favor the reporting of insights than actual codes (such as SQL) that are a necessary first step. In other words, I don't see myself as an efficient coder, rather an expert in extracting and communicating actionable insights.
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning R, Python, SQL, Alteryx
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help improve lives as directly as possible
- 📫 How to reach me 4kammer at gmail
