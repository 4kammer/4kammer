- 👋 Hi, I’m @4kammer
- 👀 I am passionate about uncovering valuable insights through data science and favor the storytelling over coding (honest!).
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning R, Python, SQL, Alteryx while keeping my fangs sharp in visuualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help improve lives as directly as possible
